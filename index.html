On November 7, 1867, Marie Salomea Skodowska-Curie was born in Warsaw. She attended neighbourhood schools where she obtained a general education and some scientific training from her father. She moved to Paris in 1891 to complete her studies at the Sorbonne, where she earned Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. In 1894, she met Professor Pierre Curie at the School of Physics; the following year, they were married. Following the tragic passing of Pierre Curie in 1906, she succeeded her husband as the head of the physics laboratory at the Sorbonne, earned a Doctorate in Science in 1903, and became the first woman to hold the position of Professor of General Physics in the Faculty of Sciences.
